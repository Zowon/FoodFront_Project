# FoodFront Restaurant Website

This is a simple static website project for a restaurant called **FoodFront**. It is built using only HTML and CSS, and is organized for easy understanding and use.

## Project Structure

- **Home.html**: The main homepage of the restaurant website.
- **Contact.html**: The contact page where users can find contact information and a form.
- **css/**: This folder contains all the CSS files for styling the website.
  - `style.css`: The main stylesheet for the website.
- **images/**: This folder contains all the images (PNG, JPG, SVG) used in the website.

## How to Use

1. **Open the Website**: Double-click on `Home.html` to open the homepage in your web browser. You can also open `Contact.html` the same way.
2. **Explore**: Navigate between the Home and Contact pages using the links in the navigation bar.
3. **Edit**: You can edit the HTML or CSS files to customize the website as you like.

## Notes
- All images are stored in the `images/` folder. If you add new images, place them here and update the HTML or CSS to use the correct path (e.g., `images/your-image.png`).
- All styles are in `css/style.css`. If you want to change the look of the website, edit this file.
